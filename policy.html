  <h1>Privacy Policy for Asset Tracker App</h1>

  <p>Effective Date: June 17, 2025</p>

  <p>Malume does not collect or share any personal information directly. The app connects users (parents and drivers) to track school bus trips in real time using GPS data.</p>

  <h2>What We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Device Location:</strong> Only used for accessing user location when selecting stop and for map familiarity.</li>
    <li><strong>User Input:</strong> Names and contact info if entered by parents to receive notifications.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>Data is never shared with third parties. It is only used for the purpose of bus tracking within the app.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>The app is intended for use by parents and drivers. While it may involve data about children (e.g., pickup/drop-off info), no child accesses the app directly.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Trip and location data may be stored for up to 30 days to improve service reliability, after which it is deleted.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@malume.app">support@malume.app</a>.</p>
