    <li><strong>Device Location:</strong> Only used for tracking the school bus location during trips.</li>
    <li><strong>User Input:</strong> Names and contact info if entered by parents to receive notifications.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>Data is never shared with third parties. It is only used for the purpose of bus tracking within the app.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>The app is intended for use by parents and drivers. While it may involve data about children (e.g., pickup/drop-off info), no child accesses the app directly.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Trip and location data may be stored for up to 30 days to improve service reliability, after which it is deleted.</p>
